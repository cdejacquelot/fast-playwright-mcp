# This file is now unused
# The test server now generates mock certificates at runtime instead of using hardcoded certificates
# 
# To use custom certificates, set these environment variables:
# - TEST_PRIVATE_KEY: Your private key in PEM format
# - TEST_CERTIFICATE: Your certificate in PEM format
# 
# If these environment variables are not set, the server will automatically
# generate mock certificates suitable for testing purposes.
#
# Original hardcoded certificate has been moved to cert.pem.original for reference
