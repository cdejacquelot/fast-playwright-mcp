# Playwright MCP Performance Comparison Guide

## Batch Processing Performance Measurement

### Why Batch Processing is Effective

1. **Reduction in API Calls**
   - Original: 5 MCP API calls
   - Fast (Batch): 2 MCP API calls

2. **Reduction in Response Tokens**
   - Reduces redundant information per command (headers, footers, state information)
   - Bulk exclusion of unnecessary information with globalExpectation

3. **Reduced Execution Time**
   - Reduces round-trip time between commands
   - Internally optimized execution

### Specific Comparison Example

#### Sequential (Original Playwright MCP)
```
Command 1: navigate
Response: [Full browser state + snapshot + tabs + console]

Command 2: click  
Response: [Full browser state + snapshot + tabs + console]

Command 3: wait
Response: [Full browser state + snapshot + tabs + console]

Command 4: navigate_back
Response: [Full browser state + snapshot + tabs + console]

Command 5: snapshot
Response: [Full browser state + snapshot + tabs + console]

Total: 5 responses × ~2000 tokens = ~10,000 tokens
```

#### Batch (Fast Playwright MCP)
```
Command 1: batch_execute (with globalExpectation: no snapshots)
Response: [Summary + minimal step results]

Command 2: snapshot
Response: [Full browser state + snapshot]

Total: 1 summary + 1 full response = ~3,000 tokens
```

### Expected Improvements

1. **Token Reduction**: 60-70% reduction
2. **Execution Time**: 40-50% reduction  
3. **API Calls**: 60% reduction (5→2)

## Measurement Methods

### Manual Measurement
1. Execute each command
2. Save responses to text files
3. Count characters (token count ≈ character count ÷ 4)
4. Record execution time

### Semi-automatic Measurement
```bash
# Response size comparison
wc -c original-response.txt fast-response.txt

# Token count estimation
echo "Original tokens: $(($(wc -c < original-response.txt) / 4))"
echo "Fast tokens: $(($(wc -c < fast-response.txt) / 4))"
```

## Batch Processing Best Practices

1. **Group Similar Operations**
   - Navigation operations
   - Form input operations
   - Validation operations

2. **Utilize globalExpectation**
   ```javascript
   globalExpectation: {
     includeSnapshot: false,    // No intermediate snapshots needed
     includeConsole: false,     // No console output needed
     includeCode: true,         // Execution code needed
     includeTabs: false         // No tab information needed
   }
   ```

3. **Final Snapshot Only**
   - Get only final state after batch execution
   - Use partial snapshots as needed
